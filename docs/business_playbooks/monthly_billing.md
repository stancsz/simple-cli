# Monthly Billing Cycle

This SOP manages the monthly billing process.

1. **Review Recent Invoices**: List recent invoices from Xero to avoid duplication.
2. **Generate Monthly Invoice**: Create a new invoice in Xero for the client.
3. **Update CRM Deal**: Update the associated deal in HubSpot to reflect the billing status.
