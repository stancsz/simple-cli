# Welcome to the Future of Terminal Coding ⚡

**Simple-CLI** is not just another wrapper around an LLM. It is a **autonomous swarm unit** designed to live in your shell.

It replaces the friction of "Context Switch -> Browser -> Chat -> Copy -> Paste" with a single, powerful loop: **Command -> Execution.**

---

## Why Simple-CLI?

We built this for developers who are tired of chat interfaces. We believe:
1.  **Terminals are Superior**: The command line is the fastest way to communicate with a computer.
2.  **Agents should be Agile**: An agent shouldn't take 30 seconds to boot up. It should be instant.
3.  **Code is Context**: You shouldn't have to explain your file structure. The agent should see it.

## The Innovations 🛠️

### 🧠 Just-in-Time (JIT) Agency
Most agents are generic. Simple-CLI is specific. When you run `simple --claw`, the system:
1.  **Analyzes your intent**.
2.  **Generates a persona** (e.g., "Senior React Performance Engineer").
3.  **Builds a specialized toolset** for that exact moment.
4.  **Executes and vanishes.**

### 🐝 Swarm Architecture
Why have one agent when you can have ten? Simple-CLI supports **Swarm Mode**, allowing you to spin up multiple isolated agent instances to tackle massive refactors or migrations in parallel.

### 🧬 Self-Healing & Evolution
Simple-CLI can write its own tools. If it encounters a problem it can't solve, it can write a Python script or a Node utility, save it to `skills/`, and use it immediately.
