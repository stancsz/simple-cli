**Simple-CLI** is a lean, premium agentic coding assistant designed for speed, token efficiency, and horizontal scalability. It prioritizes a "Thin Core" architecture, allowing the agent to dynamically evolve its own capabilities.

## Key Features

*   **Token Efficiency**: Surgical context management using high-fidelity repo maps.
*   **Universal Tool Support**: Native support for TypeScript tools, multi-language scripts (Python, Bash), and binaries.
*   **Agent Swarms**: Built-in orchestration for parallel, horizontally scalable agent units.
*   **Self-Evolution**: The ability for the agent to create, document, and load its own specialized skills.
