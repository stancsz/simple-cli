# Product Director Live Test Log

## Prompt
Build a simple CLI tool called 'weather-cli' that fetches weather data for a given city using a public API. You must use the 'write_files' tool to create artifacts. First, create 'reports/market_research.md' with findings. Then create 'design/wireframes.md' with design. Finally, create 'src/weather_cli.ts' with the implementation. Do not just plan or explain, EXECUTE the first step immediately. Perform one step at a time.
