# Simple Biosphere Roadmap

**Mission Statement:** [Read the Technical Constitution](../MISSION.md)

The roadmap is structured around the four anatomical layers of the Digital Biosphere.

## Phase I: The Metabolism (Observability)
*Current Focus: High-Fidelity Feedback*
- [ ] Implement eBPF probes for real-time telemetry.
- [ ] Define "Environmental Stress" metrics (energy, latency, cache hits).
- [ ] Build the Feedback Loop to inform the Genome.

## Phase II: The Immune System (Verification)
*Current Focus: Autonomous Sentinel Agents*
- [ ] Develop "White Blood Cell" agents for constant Red Teaming.
- [ ] Implement chaos engineering injection mechanisms.
- [ ] Enforce "The 5 Laws of Digital Physics" via automated verification.

## Phase III: The Genome (Symbolic Intent)
*Current Focus: Language-Agnostic Graph*
- [ ] Design the high-level Invariants and Objectives graph.
- [ ] Integrate Z3 solver for formal proof of System State.
- [ ] Implement Distributed Merkle DAG storage.

## Phase IV: The Proteome (Executable Phenotype)
*Current Focus: Ephemeral Binaries*
- [ ] Develop Ribosome Agents for JIT synthesis of binaries (WASM/eBPF).
- [ ] Implement the "Disposable Lifecycle" for code modules.
- [ ] Enable "Homeostatic Repair" (Self-Healing) workflows.

## Phase V: Autonomous Business Operations
*Current Focus: The Business OS*
- [x] Integrate Financial Operations (Xero).
- [x] Integrate CRM (HubSpot).
- [x] Integrate Project Management (Linear).
- [x] Validate Business Integrations (Playbooks & Tests).
    - ✅ Business Integrations validated via automated playbook tests.
- [x] Elastic Swarms (Auto-scaling based on demand).

## Phase VI: Visual & Desktop Agency
*Current Focus: Polyglot Desktop Orchestrator*
- [x] **Core Architecture**: Implemented `DesktopOrchestrator` with `DesktopDriver` interface.
- [x] **Smart Router**: LLM-based routing between Stagehand, Skyvern, and Computer Use.
- [x] **Drivers**:
    - [x] Stagehand (Local Browser).
    - [x] Skyvern (Vision-based Navigation).
- [x] **Validation**:
    - [x] Validated drivers via `tests/integration/desktop_validation.test.ts`.
    - [x] Validated Visual Quality Gate with aesthetic scoring.
    - [x] Established production SOPs for desktop workflows.

## Phase 8: Recursive Evolution
*Current Focus: Self-Improvement*
- [x] **Core Update**: Implement secure protocol for updating `engine.ts` (Implemented with Dual-Verification Safety Protocol).
- [x] **Enhanced Dreaming with Swarm Intelligence**:
    - Leverages Hive Mind during simulation to negotiate task routing.
    - Spawns specialized sub-agent swarms for optimal problem-solving.
    - Stores collaborative solution patterns in Brain.
    - ✅ Enhanced Dreaming now stores swarm negotiation patterns in Brain for future recall, enabling meta-learning of collaboration strategies.

## Phase 20: Continuous Real-World Validation
*Current Focus: Automated Production Showcase*
- [x] **Scheduled Runner**: GitHub Actions workflow to run the 24-hour simulation daily.
- [x] **Health Monitor Extension**: MCP module to record and serve showcase metrics.
- [x] **Dashboard Integration**: UI panel to visualize showcase history and status.
- [x] **Documentation**: Updated guides for automated validation.
