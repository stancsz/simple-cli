# Simple Biosphere Roadmap

**Mission Statement:** [Read the Technical Constitution](../MISSION.md)

The roadmap is structured around the four anatomical layers of the Digital Biosphere.

## Phase I: The Metabolism (Observability)
*Current Focus: High-Fidelity Feedback*
- [ ] Implement eBPF probes for real-time telemetry.
- [ ] Define "Environmental Stress" metrics (energy, latency, cache hits).
- [ ] Build the Feedback Loop to inform the Genome.

## Phase II: The Immune System (Verification)
*Current Focus: Autonomous Sentinel Agents*
- [ ] Develop "White Blood Cell" agents for constant Red Teaming.
- [ ] Implement chaos engineering injection mechanisms.
- [ ] Enforce "The 5 Laws of Digital Physics" via automated verification.

## Phase III: The Genome (Symbolic Intent)
*Current Focus: Language-Agnostic Graph*
- [ ] Design the high-level Invariants and Objectives graph.
- [ ] Integrate Z3 solver for formal proof of System State.
- [ ] Implement Distributed Merkle DAG storage.

## Phase IV: The Proteome (Executable Phenotype)
*Current Focus: Ephemeral Binaries*
- [ ] Develop Ribosome Agents for JIT synthesis of binaries (WASM/eBPF).
- [ ] Implement the "Disposable Lifecycle" for code modules.
- [ ] Enable "Homeostatic Repair" (Self-Healing) workflows.

## Phase V: Autonomous Business Operations
*Current Focus: The Business OS*
- [x] Integrate Financial Operations (Xero).
- [x] Integrate CRM (HubSpot).
- [x] Integrate Project Management (Linear).
- [x] Validate Business Integrations (Playbooks & Tests).

## Phase 8: Recursive Evolution
*Current Focus: Self-Improvement*
- [x] **Core Update**: Implement secure protocol for updating `engine.ts` (Implemented with Dual-Verification Safety Protocol).

## Legacy Achievements
See [Legacy Roadmap](ROADMAP_LEGACY.md) for completed milestones of the previous "Simple CLI" era.
