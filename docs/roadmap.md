# 🗺️ Roadmap: The Agent-First Execution Socket

## 🛡️ Theme: The Secure Spinal Cord
**Premise**: Simple-CLI is no longer a human-to-machine interface. It is the **standardized execution limb** for 1-million-token context models (Gemini 3, GPT-5.3-Codex). We position the tool as the high-speed, deterministic bridge between probabilistic reasoning and the raw file system.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Standardized Limb (Agent Manifest & Skill-Mapping)
*Objective: Transform the CLI into an OpenClaw-compatible limb that models can "mount" and use with zero latency.*

- [x] **OpenClaw Skill Injection**: Implement a `get_skill_map` tool that exports all CLI capabilities. ([#33](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/33))
- [ ] **Adaptive Semantic Repo Mapping**: Reduce context noise via keyword-based discovery. ([#30](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/30))
- [ ] **JIT Documentation Parsing**: Auto-register skills from `.md` files.

## 🛡️ Phase 2: The Logic Gate (Deterministic Validation Layer)
*Objective: Solve the "intent-to-action" translation fallacy by acting as the secure logic gate for probabilistic LLMs.*

- [ ] **The "Secure Spinal Cord" Validation**: Intercept and validate probabilistic commands. ([#34](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/34))
- [ ] **Autonomous Self-Correction**: Implement the 3-try loop for automated error recovery. ([#35](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/35))
- [ ] **Staging & Commit Sandbox**: Verify-then-Apply workflow for safe disk writes.

## 👻 Phase 3: Ghost Mode (Zero-UI Autonomous Infrastructure)
*Objective: Build an invisible tool that replaces the need for human typing, acting as a background autonomous workforce.*

- [ ] **Ghost Mode (Autonomous Socket)**: Persistent warm listener for streaming intents. ([#36](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/36))
- [ ] **Background Daemon Mode**: Fork long-running missions into autonomous services. ([#29](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/29))
- [ ] **Jules-Nexus**: Agent-to-Agent handoff for PR-wide builds. ([#31](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/31))

## 🚀 Phase 4: Frontier Mode (The AI Co-worker)
*Objective: Transition from "AI helper" to "AI co-worker" utilizing multi-step reasoning and direct workspace manipulation.*

- [ ] **Frontier Mission Planner**: Implement high-autonomy multi-step reasoning. ([#37](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/37))
- [ ] **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Reasoning Tier**: Optimize Frontier missions to utilize advanced reasoning.
- [ ] **Workspace Knowledge Base**: A persistent, searchable knowledge base. ([#38](https://github.com/stancsz/simple-cli/issues/38))
- [ ] **Feedback-Driven Iteration**: Active "Vibe Working" loop for asynchronous collaboration.

## 🎯 Strategic Ultimatum
Stop building a tool that *helps* humans work. Build a system that *replaces* the need for humans to type, serving as the secure, deterministic limb for the next generation of reasoning models.
