# Phase 26: Revenue Growth Validation

This document defines the core success metrics and validation parameters for the Phase 26 Autonomous Growth Engine. The autonomous growth pipeline moves prospects through a completely unassisted lifecycle: Strategic Lead Generation $\to$ Intelligent Proposal Generation $\to$ Contract Negotiation Simulation $\to$ Revenue Validation.

## Success Metrics

To validate that autonomous business expansion is not just functional, but economically viable, the system tracks the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

1. **Lead-to-Proposal Conversion Rate**
   - **Definition:** The percentage of qualified leads generated by `discover_strategic_leads` that successfully result in a customized proposal via `generate_client_proposal`.
   - **Threshold Target:** $> 50\%$
   - **Purpose:** Ensures the leads discovered are highly relevant to the agency's capabilities and corporate strategy.

2. **Proposal Acceptance Rate (Simulated)**
   - **Definition:** The percentage of generated proposals that result in a signed contract following the `simulate_contract_negotiation` process.
   - **Threshold Target:** $> 20\%$
   - **Purpose:** Validates the persuasiveness of generated proposals and the effectiveness of the autonomous negotiation swarm.

3. **Average Contract Margin**
   - **Definition:** The final gross margin on closed contracts after simulated concessions.
   - **Threshold Target:** $> 35\%$
   - **Policy Link:** Must strictly comply with `CorporatePolicy.financials.target_margin`.
   - **Purpose:** Prevents the negotiation swarm from racing to the bottom to close deals.

4. **Revenue per Autonomous Campaign**
   - **Definition:** Total Gross Deal Value secured through a single end-to-end execution of the autonomous growth loop.
   - **Threshold Target:** $> \$50,000$ (dependent on agency sizing).
   - **Purpose:** Ensures the autonomous engine contributes meaningfully to topline growth.

## Validation Flow

The `RevenueValidation` toolchain aggregates data across multiple agency memory systems to calculate these metrics:

1. **Lead Source (HubSpot Mock/CRM):** Tracks the total volume of leads generated by `discover_strategic_leads`.
2. **Proposal Source (Episodic Memory):** Tracks how many client contexts and proposals were successfully synthesized.
3. **Contract Source (Episodic Memory / Xero Mock):** Analyzes the output of `simulate_contract_negotiation` to determine if a consensus was reached and extracts the `final_margin` and `deal_value`.

If metrics fall below predefined thresholds (e.g., Conversion Rate $< 15\%$), the validation engine will issue a formal `RevenueValidationReport` highlighting the systemic failure point, triggering potential policy or positioning adjustments.
