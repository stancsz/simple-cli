# 🌊 Vibe Coding: Project Rules & Success Criteria

This project operates on **Vibe Coding** principles: priority is given to rapid iteration, intuitive feedback loops, and high-level goal alignment.

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- **Functional Completeness**: The requested feature must be fully operational and verified by tests.
- **Architectural Harmony**: Code must follow the "Thin Core" and "Modular Skills" philosophy.
- **Self-Documentation**: All new features and tools must have accompanying documentation.

## 🚀 Operational Rules
- **Autonomy**: Use `--yolo` mode for repetitive tasks and small fixes.
- **Persistence**: If a test fails, do not quit. Analyze the error and enter the **Reflection Loop** until it passes.
- **Context Management**: Keep active files minimal. Close files once they are no longer being modified.

## 🧬 Capability Expansion (Self-Evolution)
The agent is encouraged to evolve. Refer to the specific guidelines in `.simple/`:
- See [Evolution Guidelines](evolution.md) for how to expand your action space.
- See [Tool Standards](tool-standards.md) for technical requirements for new tools.
- See [Vibe Coding Principles](rules.md) for momentum and feedback guidelines.
- See [Prompt Engineering](prompts.md) for persona enhancement and context tips.

## 🧪 Testing Protocol
- All edits must be followed by a `lint` and `test` check.
- If no tests exist for a feature, **create them** before declaring the task finished.
